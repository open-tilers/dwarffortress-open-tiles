# Dwarf fortress open tiles
This is a dwarf fortress repository of open tilesets. Images aren't easy to edit via github, so we sliced the tileset into the smaller tiles and created a small script to reassemble them easily using simple config files like the ones that Dwarf fortress uses.

# Thanks
We want to give a special thank you to the generous Kruggsmash. He gave us the permission to redistribute his art under CC0, so we can use it as a base for future projects.

# How can you help
#### Tilesets
You can help us with tile art, currently we have the CP437 and the Kruggsmash tileset as a base. We also started the BlindiRL tileset, but it needs a lot of love! (Belug made some demo art, but he wishes for your help if you can!). Do not make modifications to the bases as they'll most likely be refused.

#### Assembling script
For now the assembling script is at a bare minimum, but will be worked on heavily in the next weeks by Belug to make it easier to work with. Once that is done, we will accept help with it also.

#### Pull request automation
For those who are really competent with Travis-CI or any other free for opensource project CI services, we'd like to have a CI to assble the tiles and build a tile room sample automatically on pull requests and publish the resulting images in the pull request.

#### Texts and documentation
If there's a Typo, please don't hesitate to propose a correction, you can propose typo correction directly on the github project page.

If you think you can add to the documentation please fill an issue and we will look into it! Do not hesitate to point out errors in the documentation.

# How to contibute
It's somewhat simple, but strict. 

1. First you need a github account. (The email used for your github account is gonna be public! Use one that you don't really care about.)
2. Then you open an issue in the project, that issue must describe the work that you intend to do.
3. Fork the project into your account and create a new branch, with a title linked to the work you want to do.
4. Clone the repository to your computer and start working.
5. You can commit as often as you want to save your progress.
6. Add your name to contributors.txt
7. Once you're done, push your changes to github one final time and make a pull request.
8. The pull request must have some infromation in it:
    * The reference to the issue number (something like #234)
    * What you did and why you did it
    * The images you modified, a before and after version to easily compare what you did.
    * If you are able to run the assembly script, please also give a version, before and after of the tileset you modified.
    * Accept critissism from the commiters, but you can politly argue their arguments.
9. Once the pull request is accepted, the modifications will be in master and will be in the next version.

# What to expect for the future
We want to make a software that can make the like of tilesets maker easyer, a tool that will allow you to display, edit or created tiles or tilesets projects. That software will not be limited to Dwarf fortress.

We'd also like to have more tilesets then Blind's one managed in this repository.

And in time more commiters on the project.
